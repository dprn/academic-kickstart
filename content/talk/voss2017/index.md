# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "In this talk we present a new mathematical model for the human primary visual cortex V1 and its applications to image processing, based on the well-known sub-Riemannian Citti-Petitot-Sarti model. In this model the primary visual cortex is represented as the bundle $PT\\mathbb R^2$ of directions of the plane, where each point corresponds to a neuron with both spatial location and local orientation preferences. This structure is then endowed with a sub-Riemannian metric, mimicking the long and short range connections between neurons.<br>The main novelty of ou approach is the definition of the lift of 2D images to this space, and more generally of image restoration tasks (e.g. denoising or inpainting), through a dissipation of the energy by the cortical structure. More precisely, we define a variational procedure that lifts a visual stimulus (i.e. an image) to the cortical state that both minimizes its sub-Riemannian $H^1$ norm (minimum effort of the cortex hypothesis) and at the same time re-projects back to the same image (consistency hypothesis). In sharp contrast with previous definitions of lifts (e.g. via Gabor wavelets), this method does not make use of an a-priori fixed lift procedure. This allows us to integrate into this procedure the sub-Riemannian structure of the cortex, which in turn, makes the lift sensitive to the curvature of objects composing the image, without resorting to any  post-processing diffusion over the cortical surface. <br>We will focus, in particular, on the characterization of this lift as a wavelet-type transform lift where the wavelet is a highly anisotropic distribution on $\\mathbb R^2$, which allows for a rigorous derivation of the so-called extra-classical receptive fields.<br>This is joint work with G. Peyr√©, J.-M. Mirebeau and A. Sarti."
