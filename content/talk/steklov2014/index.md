# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "We consider the evolution of a free particle on a two-dimensional manifold endowed with the degenerate Riemannian metric $ds^2=dx^2+|x|^{2\\alpha}d\\theta^2$, where $x\\in R$, $\\theta\\in S^1$ and the parameter $\\alpha\\in R$. For $\\alpha$ smaller or equal to $-1$ this metric describes cone-like manifolds (for $\\alpha=-1$ it is a flat cone). For $\\alpha=0$ it is a cylinder. For $\\alpha$ bigger or equal to $1$ it is a Grushin-like metric.<br/>In particular, we discuss whether a free particle or the heat can cross the singular set ${x=0}$ or not, and in which cases the singularity absorbs the heat. (The latter problem is known as the stochastic completeness problem.) <br/>In the last part of the talk we will present some recent results regarding the spectrum of the Laplace&ndash;Beltrami operator associated with these metrics and the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the Grushin case. <br/>This is a joint work with U. Boscain and M. Seri."
