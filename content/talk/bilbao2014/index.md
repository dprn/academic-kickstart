# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "We study spectral properties of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a class of relevant almost-Riemannian manifolds, namely the Grushin structures onthe cylinder and on the sphere. As for general almost-Riemannian structures [1], the singular set acts as a barrier for the evolution of the heat and of a quantum particle, although geodesics can cross it. This is a consequence of the self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on each connectedcomponent of the manifold without the singular set.<br>We will present explicit descriptions of the spectrum, of the eigenfunctions and their properties. In particular in both cases we obtain a Weyl law with dominant term $E\\log E$. We will also discuss the drastic effect that an Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential has on the spectral properties. <br> Finally, in the last part of the talk we will consider some other generalized Riemannian structures including conic and anti-conic type manifolds [2]. In this case, the Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential can affect the self-adjointness  of  the  Laplace-Beltrami  operator,  altering  the  nature  of  the communication between the two sides of the singularity.<br>This is a joint work with U. Boscain and M. Seri.<br>[1]  Boscain, U., Laurent, C., The Laplace-Beltrami operator in almost-Riemannian Geometry, Ann. Inst. Fourier, to appear.<br>[2]  Boscain,  U.,  Prandi,  D.,  The  heat  and  Schr√∂dinger  equations  on  conic  and anticonic-type surfaces, preprint."
