# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "We present a mathematical model for the human primary visual cortex V1 and its applications to image processing, based on the sub-Riemannian Citti-Petitot-Sarti model. In this model the primary visual cortex is represented as the bundle $PT\\mathbb R^2$ of directions of the plane, where each point corresponds to a neuron with both spatial location and local orientation preferences, endowed with a sub-Riemannian structure. Several new numerical and theoretical results will be discussed."
