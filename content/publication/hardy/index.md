# Abstract.
abstract = "In this paper we study various Hardy inequalities in the Heisenberg group $\\mathbb H^n$, w.r.t. the Carnot-Carathéodory distance $\\delta$ from the origin. We firstly show that the optimal constant for the Hardy inequality is strictly smaller than $n^2=(Q−2)^{2}/4$, where $Q$ is the homogenous dimension. Then, we prove that, independently of n, the Heisenberg group does not support a radial Hardy inequality, i.e., a Hardy inequality where the gradient term is replaced by its projection along $\\nabla_{\\mathbb H}\\delta$. This is in stark contrast with the Euclidean case, where the radial Hardy inequality is equivalent to the standard one, and has the same constant. <br>Motivated by these results, we consider Hardy inequalities for non-radial directions, i.e., directions tangent to the Carnot-Carathéodory balls. In particular, we show that the associated constant is bounded on homogeneous cones $C_\\Sigma$ with base $\\Sigma\\subset\\mathbb{S}^{2n}$, even when $\\Sigma$ degenerates to a point. This is a genuinely sub-Riemannian behavior, as such constant is well-known to explode for homogeneous cones in the Euclidean space."
