abstract = "We study the evolution of the heat and of a free quantum particle (described by the Schrödinger equation) on two-dimensional manifolds endowed with the degenerate Riemannian metric $ds^2=dx^2+|x|^{−2\\alpha}d\\theta^2$, where $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $\\theta\\in\\mathbb{T}$ and the parameter $\\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}$. For $\\alpha\\le−1$ this metric describes cone-like manifolds (for $\\alpha=−1$ it is a flat cone). For $\\alpha=0$ it is a cylinder. For $\\alpha\\ge1$ it is a Grushin-like metric. We show that the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is essentially self-adjoint if and only if $\\alpha\\notin(−3,1)$. In this case the only self-adjoint extension is the Friedrichs extension $\\Delta_F$, that does not allow communication through the singular set $x=0$ both for the heat and for a quantum particle. For $\\alpha\\in(−3,−1]$ we show that for the Schrödinger equation only the average on $\\theta$ of the wave function can cross the singular set, while the solutions of the only Markovian extension of the heat equation (which indeed is $\\Delta_F$) cannot. For $\\alpha\\in(−1,1)$ we prove that there exists a canonical self-adjoint extension $\\Delta_B$, called bridging extension, which is Markovian and allows the complete communication through the singularity (both of the heat and of a quantum particle). Also, we study the stochastic completeness (i.e., conservation of the $L^1$ norm for the heat equation) of the Markovian extensions $\\Delta_F$ and $\\Delta_B$, proving that $\\Delta_F$ is stochastically complete at the singularity if and only if $\\alpha\\le−1$, while $\\Delta_B$ is always stochastically complete at the singularity."
