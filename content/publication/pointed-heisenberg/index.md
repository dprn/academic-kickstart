# Abstract.
abstract = "In this paper we show that, for a sub-Laplacian $\\Delta$ on a $3$-dimensional manifold $M$, no point interaction centered at a contact point $q_0\\in M$ exists. When $M$ is complete w.r.t. the associated sub-Riemannian structure, this means that $\\Delta$ acting on $C^\\infty_0(M\\setminus\\{q_0\\})$ is essentially self-adjoint. A particular example is  the standard sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. This is in stark contrast with what happens in a Riemannian manifold $N$, whose associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is never essentially self-adjoint on $C^\\infty_0(N\\setminus\\{q_0\\})$, if $\\dim N\\le 3$. We then apply this result to the Schr√∂dinger evolution of a thin molecule, i.e., with a vanishing  moment of inertia, rotating around its center of mass."
