 abstract = {It is well-known, since [12], that cells in the primary visual cortex V1 do much more than merely signaling position in the visual field: most cortical cells signal the local orientation of a contrast edge or bar -- they are tuned to a particular local orientation. This orientation tuning has been given a mathematical interpretation in a sub-Riemannian model by Petitot, Citti, and Sarti [6, 14]. According to this model, the primary visual cortex V1 lifts grey-scale images, given as functions \$\$f:\\backslashmathbb R2̂\backslashrightarrow [0,1]\$\$f:R2\textrightarrow[0,1], to functions Lf defined on the projectivized tangent bundle of the plane \$\$PT\backslashmathbb R^2 = \backslashmathbb R^2\backslashtimes \backslashmathbb P^1\$\$PTR2=R2×P1. Recently, in [1], the authors presented a promising semidiscrete variant of this model where the Euclidean group of rototranslations SE(2), which is the double covering of \$\$PT\backslashmathbb R^2\$\$PTR2, is replaced by SE(2, N), the group of translations and discrete rotations. In particular, in [15], an implementation of this model allowed for state-of-the-art image inpaintings.},
