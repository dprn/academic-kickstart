abstract="We prove a general essential self-adjointness criterion for sub-Laplacians on complete sub-Riemannian manifolds, defined with respect to singular measures. We also show that, in the compact case, this criterion implies discreteness of the sub-Laplacian spectrum even though the total volume of the manifold is infinite. As a consequence of our result, the intrinsic sub-Laplacian (i.e. defined w.r.t. Popp's measure) is essentially self-adjoint on the equiregular connected components of a sub-Riemannian manifold. This settles a conjecture formulated by Boscain and Laurent (Ann. Inst. Fourier (Grenoble) 63(5), 1739--1770, 2013), under mild regularity assumptions on the singular region, and when the latter does not contain characteristic points.",
