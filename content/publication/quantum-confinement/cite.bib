abstract = {We consider the quantum completeness problem, i.e. the problem of confining quantum particles, on a non-complete Riemannian manifold {\$}M{\$} equipped with a smooth measure {\$}\backslashomega{\$}, possibly degenerate or singular near the metric boundary of {\$}M{\$}, and in presence of a real-valued potential {\$}V\backslashin L{\^{}}2{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}loc{\}}{\}}(M){\$}. The main merit of this paper is the identification of an intrinsic quantity, the effective potential {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}{\$}, which allows to formulate simple criteria for quantum confinement. Let {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} be the distance from the possibly non-compact metric boundary of {\$}M{\$}. A simplified version of the main result guarantees quantum completeness if {\$}V\backslashge -c\backslashdelta{\^{}}2{\$} far from the metric boundary and $\backslash$[ V{\_}{\{}$\backslash$mathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}+V$\backslash$ge $\backslash$frac3{\{}4$\backslash$delta{\^{}}2{\}}-$\backslash$frac{\{}$\backslash$kappa{\}}{\{}$\backslash$delta{\}}, $\backslash$qquad $\backslash$text{\{}close to the metric boundary{\}}. $\backslash$] These criteria allow us to: (i) obtain quantum confinement results for measures with degeneracies or singularities near the metric boundary of {\$}M{\$}; (ii) generalize the Kalf-Walter-Schmincke-Simon Theorem for strongly singular potentials to the Riemannian setting for any dimension of the singularity; (iii) give the first, to our knowledge, curvature-based criteria for self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator; (iv) prove, under mild regularity assumptions, that the Laplace-Beltrami operator in almost-Riemannian geometry is essentially self-adjoint, partially settling a conjecture formulated in [Boscain, Laurent - Ann. Inst. Fourier, 2013] .},
